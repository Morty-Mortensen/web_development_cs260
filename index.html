    <h2>Here is a list about me.</h2>
<!----Headings, Paragraphs, Other things you can see----->
    <ul>
        <li>Here is a short statement about myself: I like running and I'm creating this website for
            a club that I am a part of called "Dota Cougs".</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Here are three projects I have worked on:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I created a relational database</li>
        <li>I've set up an account on GitHub (shout out to them)</li>
        <li>I am currently creating my very first server-based website!</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Here is a list of my experience:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I work currently as a Quality Assurance Specialist (I test software and try to break it).</li>
        <li>I've worked in a neuroscience research lab for a few months, testing the effects of alcohol on
        different parts of the brain.</li>
        <li>I've worked with GIT before, but never really understood the different parts (or how to set up a repository) until now.</li>
        <li>I created a local HTML page for a projected once, but I learned now that I used inline css, which appears to
        not be a very efficient way of displaying it.</li>
        <li>I also had my own lawn mowing business when I was younger.</li>
    </ol>
